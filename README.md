# RayTracer

This is an archive of a raytracer rendering program for Intro to Computer Graphics at my undergraduate university. All files used to render scenes on the accompanying site are included in this repo under the '*part__*' directories. The program is capable of rendering individual scenes, as well as multiple scenes in succession for planar, spherical, and cylindrical animation.

**Please note:** the accompanying '.jar' application was written by Professor [Ivalyo Ilinkin](https://www.gettysburg.edu/academic-programs/computer-science/faculty/employee_detail.dot?empId=04006600720013294&pageTitle=Ivaylo+Ilinkin) of Gettysburg College, I only kept it here as it is a useful tool to view *.PPM* files on Windows and it can create an *APNG* file from multiple rendered *.PPM* files, making an 'animated' scene. The same applies for all models and maps, these were provided by Professor Ilinkin as handouts.
